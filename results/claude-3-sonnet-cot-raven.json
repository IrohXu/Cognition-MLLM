Option 1 matches this pattern correctly.", "answer": "3.jpeg", "id": "in_distribute_four_out_center_single_RAVEN_36_val", "groundtruth": "3.jpeg"}, {"first_row": "The first row consists of three black squares of the same size.", "second_row": "The second row also has three black squares of the same size.", "third_row": "The third row has two black squares of the same size on the left.", "option_set": "The option images contain various shapes like circles, pentagons, triangles, squares, and hexagons in different shades of black and white.", "reasoning": "Based on the patterns in the rows, the missing shape in the bottom-right cell should be a black square of the same size as the other squares in the matrix. Among the options, Option 3 contains two identical black squares, matching the pattern of squares in the matrix.", "answer": "7.jpeg", "id": "distribute_nine_RAVEN_76_val", "groundtruth": "7.jpeg"}]
